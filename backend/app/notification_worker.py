"""Run with `python -m app.notification_worker`.

Executes NotificationWorkflow and its activities on their own task queues,
separate from the main temporal-worker (app/temporal_worker.py) — deploy
this on different hardware if you like, so a notification/email backlog can
never starve the job-search/application worker's capacity.

Two Worker instances share this process:
  - "notifications": NotificationWorkflow, create_notification_activity,
    mark_delivery_dead_activity. No special rate limit — these only touch
    the database.
  - "notifications-email": send_notification_email_activity only, capped at
    NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND (server-enforced by Temporal,
    holds even with several worker processes polling this queue at once) to
    stay under Resend's own per-team rate limit.
