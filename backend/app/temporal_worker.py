"""Run with `python -m app.temporal_worker`. Scale this service independently.

This process executes every durable job — agent runs, job searches,
applications, follow-ups — and registers the recurring Schedules (daily job
search, maintenance, and in server-browser mode the status check). Nothing
the API starts makes progress unless at least one of these is running.
