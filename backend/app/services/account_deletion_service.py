"""Hard-deletes accounts whose 15-day deletion grace period has elapsed.

Requesting deletion (see app.api.v1.users) never removes anything itself —
it only stamps deletion_scheduled_for. This module is the other half: a
periodic sweep (called from the maintenance activity) that finds accounts
past that date and actually deletes them.

Deleting the users row cascades to every table keyed to it, but some of a
member's data lives elsewhere: running workflows, Nango grants, uploaded
files, RAG collections and agent memory (keyed by a text user_id with no
foreign key), Redis keys, and the Clerk identity. Each of those is erased
first, Clerk last; only then is the row deleted. Every step is idempotent,
so when one fails the row stays and the next sweep finishes the job.
