# Nango Integration Gateway

CareerCraft exposes provider-neutral integration APIs backed by Nango when
`NANGO_ENABLED=true`. The backend alone reads `NANGO_SECRET_KEY`; browsers
receive only the short-lived Connect-session values returned by Nango.

## Configure Nango

Create the required Google Mail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Microsoft
Outlook Mail, and Microsoft Outlook Calendar integrations in the target Nango
environment. Set their **integration unique keys** in one JSON environment
variable; these keys are deployment-specific and must not be copied from an
example project.

```dotenv
NANGO_ENABLED=true
NANGO_BASE_URL=https://api.nango.dev
NANGO_SECRET_KEY=server-only-environment-api-key
NANGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=webhook-signing-key
NANGO_PROVIDER_CONFIG_KEYS={"gmail":"google-mail-prod","google_drive":"google-drive-prod","google_calendar":"google-calendar-prod","outlook_mail":"outlook-mail-prod","outlook_calendar":"outlook-calendar-prod"}
```

Set the Nango webhook URL to
`https://<api-host>/api/v1/integrations/webhooks/nango`. The endpoint verifies
Nango's documented `X-Nango-Hmac-Sha256` HMAC-SHA256 signature over the raw
body. It stores a deterministic event hash before processing, so duplicate
deliveries are harmless. Do not place the environment API key or webhook key
in any `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable.

Apply `supabase/migrations/0037_integration_connections.sql` before enabling
the feature. It adds local provider-neutral connection and webhook replay
ledgers only; it never copies OAuth access or refresh tokens out of Nango.

## API and browser flow

1. The authenticated client calls `POST /api/v1/integrations/connect-session`
   with a supported provider and same-origin return path.
2. The backend creates a Nango Connect session and records a local `pending`
   connection.
3. The client follows the returned short-lived `connect_link`.
4. Nango confirms the connection through the verified webhook. Clients refresh
   `GET /api/v1/integrations`; frontend callbacks alone never mark a connection
   as connected.

Supported provider IDs are `gmail`, `google_drive`, `google_calendar`,
`outlook_mail`, and `outlook_calendar`. The APIs never return provider tokens.

Gmail and Drive use Nango's proxy exclusively. Existing encrypted Google token
columns are retained in the database for a safe, non-destructive rollout but
are no longer read or written by application code. Users with an old direct
connection must reconnect through Nango.

## Disabling Nango

There is no direct-OAuth fallback: Gmail and Drive route through Nango's proxy
exclusively. Setting `NANGO_ENABLED=false` does not restore the old Google
OAuth flow — it removes it entirely, since `google_oauth_service.py` and the
encrypted Google token columns are no longer read or written by application
code. Disabling Nango simply disables Gmail and Drive until it is re-enabled.

The database migration is additive; retain its connection records for audit
and replay protection. If a database rollback is required before the feature
is used, the commented safe downgrade statements in migration `0037` remove
only the two Nango tables.

and [webhook verification documentation](https://docs.nango.dev/guides/platform/webhooks)
when creating or rotating Nango credentials.
