# Security

This document covers CareerCraft AI's security architecture, threat model, known CVEs, and audit process.

---

## Threat Model

| Asset | Threat | Control |
|---|---|---|
| User API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) | Read from DB | AES-256-GCM encryption at rest |
| User resume data | Unauthorized access | RLS: `user_id = auth.uid()` enforced in DB |
| Job application actions | CSRF / replay | JWT on every request; HITL gate for irreversible actions |
| Email sending (Gmail) | Sending without consent | Server-side HITL gate; `/approve` endpoint required |
| Browser automation | Cross-user contamination | Playwright isolated browser context per user |
| Admin endpoints | Public access | Nginx blocks `/internal/*` at edge |
| Rate limiting | Credential stuffing / scraping | slowapi (60 req/min/user), Nginx (10 req/min for auth) |

---

## Authentication

### Supabase JWT Verification

All protected backend routes verify the Supabase access token locally in `supabase_auth.py`:

```python
# Verification: no round-trip to Supabase on each request
payload = jwt.decode(
    token,
    SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET,
    algorithms=["HS256"],
    audience="authenticated"
)
user_id = payload["sub"]
```

The `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` comes from Supabase dashboard → Settings → API. It must be kept secret — exposure allows forging tokens.

### Frontend Session Management

- `@supabase/ssr` manages cookie-based sessions
- `middleware.ts` calls `supabase.auth.getUser()` on every request and refreshes expired tokens
- Unauthenticated requests to `(app)/*` routes are redirected to `/login`
- Access tokens are short-lived (1 hour); refresh tokens are rotated on use

### OAuth Scopes

Google OAuth requests only the minimum necessary scopes:
- `email`, `profile` — for account creation
- `gmail.send`, `gmail.readonly` — for Email Agent
- `drive.readonly` — for importing resume from Google Drive (optional)

## API Key Encryption

User AI provider API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before database storage.

**Key derivation** (`security.py`):
```python
# Each key gets a unique salt
salt = os.urandom(16)
# PBKDF2 derives an encryption key from APP_SECRET_KEY + salt
encryption_key = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
    length=32,
    salt=salt,
    iterations=100_000,
).derive(APP_SECRET_KEY.encode())
# AES-256-GCM encryption (includes integrity check)
ciphertext, nonce, tag = aes_256_gcm_encrypt(key, plaintext)
```

Stored columns: `api_key_enc` (ciphertext + nonce + tag), `api_key_salt` (per-key salt).

**Decryption happens only once per request**, in `llm_gateway.py`, immediately before the LLM call. The plaintext key is never stored in Redis, logs, or DB.

---

## Row-Level Security

Every user data table has RLS enabled. Policies enforce that users can only SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE their own rows:

```sql
-- Example: applications table
ALTER TABLE public.applications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "users see own applications"
  ON public.applications
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    user_id = (SELECT id FROM public.users WHERE supabase_uid = auth.uid())
  );
```

This means even a bug in application code that constructs a wrong query cannot return another user's data — the database enforces isolation.

**Tables with RLS:** `users`, `user_model_settings`, `user_preferences`, `documents`, `resume_personas`, `applications`, `agent_runs`, `cover_letter_versions`, `interview_sessions`, `salary_reports`, `leads`, `linkedin_outreach_queue`, `ats_scores`

**Tables without RLS:** `company_intel` (shared public data, no PII)

---

## Rate Limiting

Two layers:

**Nginx (per IP):**
```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=auth:10m rate=10r/m;
# Applied to: /auth/*, /api/v1/users/model-settings
```

**slowapi (per authenticated user):**
```python
@limiter.limit("60/minute")  # default
@limiter.limit("10/minute")  # agent runs
@limiter.limit("5/minute")   # document uploads
```

Rate limit headers on every response: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`.

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Gate

No agent can send an email or submit a job application without user approval. This is enforced server-side:

1. Agent emits `pending_action` in state and pauses
2. Backend stores the pending action in Redis with the `run_id` key
3. SSE `checkpoint` event reaches the frontend
4. Frontend renders `ApprovalModal` with full action preview
5. **Only** `POST /api/v1/agents/{run_id}/approve {approved: true}` resumes the action
6. Any other code path (background jobs, direct service calls) cannot bypass this

The `/approve` endpoint verifies:
- JWT belongs to the user who owns the run
- Run is in `pending_approval` state
- Action type matches what was stored server-side (prevents parameter tampering)

---

## Internal Endpoints

The BullMQ worker calls `localhost:8000/internal/*` directly (Docker internal network). These routes are never exposed publicly:

```nginx
location /internal/ {
    return 404;
}
```

Internal routes bypass JWT auth (they use a shared `INTERNAL_SECRET` header) and are only accessible from the `worker` container on the Docker network.

---

## Browser Automation Security

Playwright creates an isolated browser context per user:
- Cookies and sessions are not shared between users
- Each automation run uses a fresh browser profile
- Human-like delays (randomized 0.5–2s between actions) to avoid bot detection
- LinkedIn and Naukri automation may violate their ToS — users acknowledge this in onboarding

---

## Input Validation

All API inputs are validated by Pydantic models before reaching business logic. SQLAlchemy uses parameterized queries — no raw SQL with user input.

Security tests verify:
- SQL injection attempts return 422 (Pydantic rejects them before DB)
- XSS payloads in text fields are stored as plain text (no HTML rendering server-side)
- Oversized uploads are rejected by file size limits in `rag.py`

---

## Known CVEs and Patches

| CVE | Component | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CVE-2025-68664 | LangChain serialization | Fixed — `langchain-core>=1.4.0` in `constraints.txt` |
| CVE-2025-67644 | LangGraph SQLite injection | Blocked — `langchain-core<1.3.0` excluded in `constraints.txt` |
| langchain-community removal | Vector store dependency | Replaced with `langchain-postgres==0.0.17` |

`constraints.txt` pins upper bounds for all packages with active CVEs. Always run `pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt` to respect these bounds.

## Security Testing

### Automated (CI)

```bash
# SAST — static analysis, blocks on HIGH severity
cd backend && bandit -r app/ -f txt

# Dependency CVE scan
pip-audit
npm audit
```

### Test suite

```bash
# 6 security-specific tests
cd backend && pytest tests/security -v
```

Security tests cover:
- `test_sql_injection.py` — SQL injection attempts rejected
- `test_xss.py` — XSS payloads stored safely
- `test_auth_required.py` — all protected endpoints return 401 without JWT
- `test_rls.py` — users cannot access other users' data
- `test_api_key_encryption.py` — stored keys are ciphertext, not plaintext
- `test_rate_limiting.py` — 429 returned after limit exceeded
